The data management technique described here supplies an adequate foundation for securing and tracking outsourced encrypted data. Access to sensitive information encrypted is strictly forbidden by recommendations and keys set by the data owner. The system takes a phased approach, starting with storing the current data view (Dcur) in a cloud repository, which serves as the foundation for all evaluations and modifications. For suggestion changes, verified stakeholders with write the authorizations access the data via a cloud service provider (CSP). The system aggregates knowledge of provenance using SMTP, ensuring transparency and integrity in the modification process. The talked about phases include stakeholder submission, owner acceptance or rejection, and formally signed confirmation of recommended adjustments, ultimately leading to a secure and traceable data modification process.

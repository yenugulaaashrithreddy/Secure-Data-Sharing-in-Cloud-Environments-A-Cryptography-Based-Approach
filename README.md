# Secure Data Sharing in Cloud Environments: A Cryptography-Based Approach
In a society controlled by technological advancement, safeguarding private data archived in the cloud is growing crucial. Our endeavour addresses this pressing the necessity by setting up a robust framework for securely conserving and accessing data in the cloud while retaining transparency and accountability via algorithms for encryption, secure preservation methods, and grave authorization techniques. Our solution works effortlessly with Azure cloud services, permitting users and owners to securely archive and retrieve content. Owners start the process by selecting files and assigning keys before publishing them to Azure. Significantly, metadata like as file names, MAC addresses, and an AES-encrypted encryption key are retained in a MySQL database, alongside owner and user credentials. The Data Provenance System is an essential feature of the system we use. It accurately logs each exchange with the stored information. For users who need access to these files, our system uses an intricate information traceability procedure that interacts with the MySQL database. Once permitted, users are prompted to provide their preferred file name, which commences the authentication and verification procedure. Moreover, our solution makes collaborating to edit easier by permitting users to customise files. Fortunately prior publishing changed files back to the cloud, users must receive authentication approval from the owner, which ensures data integrity throughout the process.Â In general, the study we conducted addresses the fundamental issues of shielded storage of information in the cloud yet concurrently highlighting the critical importance of data origination and access oversight in contemporary digital society. By integrating modern encryption techniques with restricted security measures, we provide a cost-effective solution for safeguarding personal information in cloud configurations.
